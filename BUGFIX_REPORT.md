# Kivy-Desktop Real Estate Management System - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

Two main issues were addressed in this update:

### 1. Color Mapping

Fixed the warnings like "Color 'primary' not found, using default" and "Color 'text_primary' not found, using default" by:

- Adding a color mapping dictionary in `app/config.py` that maps shortened color names (like 'primary') to their full theme manager names (like 'primary_color')
- Updating the `get_color()` method to use this mapping
- This ensures that when components use short color names, they are properly translated to the theme manager's naming convention

### 2. Window Size Configuration

Resolved the warning "Both Window.minimum_width and Window.minimum_height must be bigger than 0 for the size restriction to take effect" by:

- Setting window properties early in the application lifecycle using Kivy's Config module
- Adding explicit minimum size properties to the Config class for direct access
- Ensuring minimum sizes are always positive numbers
- Setting the window size after the minimum size constraints

## Files Modified

1. `app/config.py`:

   - Added properties for direct access to window dimensions
   - Added mapping dictionary for color names

2. `main.py`:
   - Reorganized imports to set Kivy Config values before Window is imported
   - Simplified the build() method by removing redundant window configuration
   - Fixed indentation and syntax issues

## Testing

Both issues have been verified as fixed - the application now:

- Properly displays colors using the shorthand names
- Sets window dimensions correctly without warnings
- Maintains the minimum size constraints for the window

## Next Steps

- Continue testing to ensure all UI elements appear correctly
- Monitor for any additional warnings or issues related to theming or window handling
