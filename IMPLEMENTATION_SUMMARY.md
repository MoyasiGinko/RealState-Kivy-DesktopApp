db_manager = DatabaseManager('database.db')
with create_main_controller(db_manager) as main_controller:

    # All functionality is available through main_controller
    properties = main_controller.get_all_properties()
    owners = main_controller.get_all_owners()

    # Generate reports
    report_path = main_controller.generate_property_summary_report()

    # Create backups
    backup_path = main_controller.create_full_backup()

    # Manage settings
    settings = main_controller.get_settings()
```
