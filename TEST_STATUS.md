# Real Estate Management System - Testing Status

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Database Connection Errors

- **Issue**: `'DatabaseManager' object has no attribute 'connection'`
- **Solution**: Fixed reference data methods to use `self.get_connection()` instead of `self.connection`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. SQL Column Name Mismatches

- **Issue**: `no such column: r.Province-code` and `no such column: r.created_date`
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed column names to match actual database schema (with trailing spaces)
  - Updated `Province-code` to `Province-code ` (with space)
  - Updated `Buildtcode` to `Buildtcode ` (with space)
  - Replaced `created_date` with `Companyco` for ordering
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Deprecated Kivy Properties

- **Issue**: Warnings about deprecated `allow_stretch` and `keep_ratio` properties
- **Solution**: Replaced with `fit_mode="contain"` in all image components
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Import Statement Issues

- **Solution**: Used aliasing `CustomActionButton as ActionButton` throughout screens
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
